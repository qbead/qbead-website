# Dynamical Decoupling

This example demonstrates the dynamical decoupling of a quantum state.
The user is presented with a target state and a current state.
The current state is a quantum state that is subject to decoherence.
The target state is fixed.
The goal of the "game" is to not let the current state deviate too much from the target state.

The current state experiences decoherence (i.e. it is rotated around a fixed laboratory frame).
The method of "dynamical decoupling" is used to combat the decoherence by frequently changing the axis of decoherence.

The user can tap the Qbead to reset the current state to the target state.

<div class="literate-text">

First, let's include the Qbead library and set up a few useful data structures.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
#include <Qbead.h>

Qbead::Qbead bead;

BlochVector current_state(90, 0);
BlochVector target_state(90, 0);
```

<div class="literate-text">

Prepare some colors for the visualization during the game.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
uint32_t purple = color(255, 0, 255);
uint32_t white = color(255, 255, 255);
```

<div class="literate-text">

## Setup

The setup function is called once when the Qbead is powered on and it is used to initialize the Qbead and set up the game.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
void setup() {
  bead.begin();
  bead.setBrightness(25);
```

<div class="literate-text">

Test the pixels by flashing a colorful pattern to make sure they are working.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
  bead.testPixels();
}
```

<div class="literate-text">

## Event loop

The loop function is called repeatedly until the Qbead is powered off.
It is used to read the IMU and update the current state of the game.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
void loop() {
  static bool current_state_visible = true;
```

<div class="literate-text">

Clear the display.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
  bead.clear();
```

<div class="literate-text">

### Draw the "reference" state -- the one corresponding to no decoherence.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
  bead.setBloch_deg_smooth(target_state, white);
```

<div class="literate-text">

### Draw the current state, as it evolves over time under the influence of decoherence.

</div>

<div class="literate-text">

The current state is only visible when the user has tapped to reveal it.
Each tap toggles the visibility on or off.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
  if (current_state_visible) {
    bead.setBloch_deg(current_state, purple);
  }
```

<div class="literate-text">

Show the result.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
  bead.show();
```

<div class="literate-text">

### Simulate the decoherence

The decoherence is simulated by rotating the current state around a fixed laboratory frame.
We happen to use the direction of gravity as reported by the IMU in this example.

</div>

```cpp class=codeblock
  current_state.rotateAround(BlochVector(bead.x, bead.y, bead.z), 0.2);

  if (bead.wasTapped()) {
    Serial.println("TAP");
    current_state_visible = !current_state_visible;
  }

  current_state_visible = current_state_visible || (millis() < 5000);

  Serial.print(millis());
  Serial.print("  | Visible: ");
  Serial.print(current_state_visible);
  Serial.print(" | Angle: ");
  Serial.print(current_state.phi);
  Serial.print(" | Speed: ");
  Serial.println(rotation_speed);
}
```
