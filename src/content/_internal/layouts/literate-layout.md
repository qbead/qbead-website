# Literate Layout

This page uses `layout: literate`. This layout is specifically designed for literate programming documentation. It is intended to be used by markdown content that is auto-generated from the `codedocs` build process.

See the [main README](https://github.com/qbead/qbead-website/blob/main/README.md#literate-programming-rendering) for details.

</div>

```md class=codeblock

layout: literate
---
```

<div class="literate-text">

## When to Use

**Usually auto-generated** - This layout is primarily used for literate programming documentation generated by the Makefile from external repositories.

</div>

<div class="literate-text">

## How it works

Normal text needs to be inside of `<div>` blocks with a `literate-text` class.
Code blocks will need to have extra metadata stating `class=codeblock`.

See the code example for how this portion of the page was rendered.
