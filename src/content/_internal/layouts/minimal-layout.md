# Minimal Layout

This page uses `layout: minimal` - giving you **complete control** over styling and structure. Notice there's no automatic container, typography, or styling - you're responsible for everything.

## When to Use

Use minimal layout when you need:
- **Custom landing pages** with unique designs
- **Full control** over spacing and structure
- Only use it when it's a one-off, and it wouldn't be worth it to create another layout.

## Frontmatter
