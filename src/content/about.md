The Qbead comes with a "Field Guide" containing multiple educational and artistic activities written for students ages 12 - 212. In addition of the quantum science topics, the Qbead can also be programmed by anyone simply as a beautiful luminescent bluetooth-connected motion-sensing fashion accessory.
